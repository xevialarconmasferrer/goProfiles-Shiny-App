Shiny theme:

I used a different theme (bootstrap) to stilish the aplication from the "shinythemes" package. In order to upgrade the appereance of the app with this bootsrap you just need to include in the folder where you have the app code, the folder "www" from the repository. Or create a new folder cold "www" in the same folder as you have the app, and include the file bootstrap.min3.css in this folder. You can download the file bootstrap.min3.css from the repository.
