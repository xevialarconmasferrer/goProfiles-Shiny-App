#  goProfiles App

# "goProfiles" is a R package, created by: Alex SÃ¡nchez, Jordi Ocana and Miquel Salicru (2011). Ths package  creates functional profiles from lists of genes and does a comparative 
#  analysis to evaluate how equivalent those profiles are. The main reason this application was created is to allow scientist to compare lists of genes obtained from similar 
#  experiments. Lets say for example that to laboratories make the same experiment. We could think that the expected results should be the same, but some times do to differences on
#  the methodology, the technoloy used or the "human" manipulation it is posible that does results may differ. Sometimes it is interesting to combine results in order to have more
#  data so the study become more robust. We need a tool that allows as to evaluate how equal are this results to be combined. goProfiles does precisly that.
#  The methodology  behind this functionality consists on a global test of Euclidean distance in order to evaluate globally the proximity of those lists, and in case that we see 
#  differences, a Fisher test class-by-class to see in which related  ontological categories we see those diferences.

#  This Application includes all the funcionalities of this package in order to make this tool avaliable to everyone who need to perform this comparative analysis and does not have 
#  notions of programming.

# Here you have the list of all the R packages required to run this application.

#  The first component of a shiny app is the "User Interface". Here in, there is all the code related to how the application is visualized. Furthermore, is where we define the 
#  "widgets", so the user is able to upload the lists, and select from different options those that he/she prefers for the analysis.  Those options selected will be inputs that 
#  will be sended to the server, where the calculations are done.
